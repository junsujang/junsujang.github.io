I am a second year Master's student at the MIT Media Lab. I research underwater 
sensors at the [Future Ocean Lab](http://futureocean.mit.edu/) and 
[Responsive Environmnents](https://resenv.media.mit.edu/). I am co-advised by
[Prof. Allan Adams](http://www.mit.edu/~awa/Allan_Adams/Home.html) and 
[Prof. Joseph Paradiso](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/joep/overview/).
My Master's thesis is on "Marine snow tracking steregraphic imaging system". As 
side projects, I have been working on modular 
[conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensors](http://futureocean.mit.edu/ctd/) and environmental DNA (eDNA) samplers.

My research interests lie in mass-deployable networks of underwater sensors that enable us
to collect ocean data with appropriate spatiotemporal resolution. I am also broadly
interested in autonomous ocean monitoring and exploring systems via sensors, floats and 
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
