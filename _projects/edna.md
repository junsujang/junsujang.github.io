We aim to build low-cost and modular eDNA sampler that could be atop anything that touches water. To not confuse which samplers are being used, each samplers/filters has an potted RFID tag attached to it, which can be scanned by a RFID reader. A user can also access a web application to configure the deployment and access the data that was collected.

In Dec 2019, two eDNA Samplers were taken on LEX-NG vessel in the Channel Islands in California for testing.
